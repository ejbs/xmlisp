  ==Example Specific Issues:==
    ===Game of Life:===

    ===Circle:===

    ===Who is Talking:===
    Cocoa's speach synthesis is not supported on the PC so instead of the objects speaking with voice synthesis their speech is forwarded to the console.  
    ===Full Screen Support:===
    Cocoa's full screen view methods do not work with Cocotron so the switch to full screen button will do nothing on Windows.
